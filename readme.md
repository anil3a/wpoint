Introduction
------------
Plugin created by Wellington Viveiro (http://www.wviveiro.com.br/en). It is used to clock in/out through the Mobile Phone.
As it only uses pure javascript and html, all data is saved in the Browser's cache (you do not need to log in/out).

Installation
------------
Upload the files on your server and access it by URL.

Important!
----------
Firefox does not support WebSQL, therefore this app does not work on Firefox.
